#Medium Editor with Default Theme

##Medium Editor
> This is a clone of [medium.com](https://medium.com) inline editor toolbar.
>
> Since I always had problems with bloated editors and I loved the simplicity of medium.com solution I've tried to implement their WYSIWYG approach with this script.
>
> MediumEditor has been written using vanilla JavaScript, no additional frameworks required.
>
> Tested on Google Chrome, Firefox and IE9+.
